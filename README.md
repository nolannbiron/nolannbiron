### Some words about me

<p>
    <🎯 />  I'm currently full-time dive into the blockchain & decentralized world, these possibilities seem absolutely incredible! 🤩
    <br>
    <🌱 /> I'm also learning Solidity, Web3.js and ethers.js to build strong dApp (React).
    <br>
    <🍺 /> Beside programming, I am interested in finance, especially in crypto. My favorite hobby is definitely watching Formula 1, it started when I was 6.
